I know you won't like me but you're here
Waiting at my door
I'm getting crazy of only being
A secret on your phone
Don't try to
Put the blame on me
We both know
We liked it

I know I'm a boy
But I can love you like her
I know I'm boy
What I feel is really bigger than hers
I know I'm a boy
But

Never dreamt feeling like this
Following my desire
I'm getting crazy of only talking
When the moon arise
Don't try to
Put the blame on me
We both know
We liked it

I know I'm a boy
But I can love you like her
I know I'm boy
What I feel is really bigger than hers
I know I'm a boy
But
